# What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic?
## You can have a closer look at each discrete value of data

# What are the disadvantages?
## With many levels, the facet doesn't fit to screen

# How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?
## Probably would go for colors or shapes

# Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do?
?facet_wrap
## Defines number of rows or columns of the grid

# What other options control the layout of the individual panels?
## scales, shrink, switch, etc

# Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol argument?
## Because these are governed by the dimensions themselves

# When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable
# with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

## No idea why! But it really seems to fit better on screen
